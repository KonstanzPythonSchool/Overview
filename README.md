## Tutorials
You can proceed in learning python by simply do more python tutorials. Here is a very short list of web sites where you can find tutorials. Depending on you prefered way of learning, you will find introduction to python on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=python) as well.

* [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/)
* [Offical Python Website](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
* [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm)
* [Scipy Lectures](https://www.scipy-lectures.org/)
* [German Tutorial](https://py-tutorial-de.readthedocs.io/de/python-3.3/)

## Use python packages/modules
Due to the large amount of python users, a very large number of python modules are available free of charge on the web. We will use some of them already during the course (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib). Here are some overviews but you will find packages for special purposes by a google search:

* [Useful modules](https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules)
* [Modules for chemistry](http://lukaszmentel.com/blog/awesome-python-chemistry/index.html)
* [Modules for finance](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-python-librariespackages-finance-financial-data-majid-aliakbar)
* [Module for bio-informatics](http://biopython.org/)
* [Modules for data science](https://medium.com/activewizards-machine-learning-company/top-15-python-libraries-for-data-science-in-in-2017-ab61b4f9b4a7)
